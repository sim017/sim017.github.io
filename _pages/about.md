I am currently working as a **Machine Learning Engineer** at **GE Healthcare, Bengaluru**. I completed by **B.Tech** in **Computer Engineering** from **National Institute of Technology, Surat**. I work in the domain of **Deep Learning** in **Medical Imaging** to develop solutions that aid the humans rather than to replace them. I have majorly worked in developing the **Human Computer Interaction systems** that pertain to remote monitoring of the patient and alert system design for critical patient care. My work also involves around scaling these systems on distributed platforms and optimise existing machine learning algorithms for faster implementation. During my experience I had an opportunity of working with cross border teams in Japan and US. This has helped me to broaden my perspectives and approach any problem in more inclusive manner.

I like to maintain my work life balance and engage in leisure activites like reading books, travelling, etc. Dan Brown happens to be my favorite author. I also like to go for jogs and freqently like to play table tennis and boxing to take work and life pressure off.
